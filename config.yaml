      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include: cloud:precise-folsom,
      cloud:precise-folsom/updates, cloud:precise-folsom/staging,
      cloud:precise-folsom/proposed.

      Note that updating this setting to a source that is known to
      provide a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software
      upgrade.

  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    default: 2
    type: int

      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores within the images rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the images
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
      your ceph cluster).
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If set to True, supporting services will log to syslog.

      HA Cluster nodes.
  ssl_cert:
    type: string
    description: |
      SSL certificate to install and use for API ports.  Setting this value
      and ssl_key will enable reverse proxying, point Glance's entry in the
      Keystone catalog to use https, and override any certficiate and key
      issued by Keystone (if it is configured to do so).
  ssl_key:
    type: string
    description: SSL key to use with certificate specified as ssl_cert.
  ssl_ca:

  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
